# Compiler_Design_Lab

### Programs covered in Compiler Design Lab (CEN-693) during the course work of VI semester (2024)

**P1: _Construct DFA_** 
- WAP to implement a program that takes an input string from the console and verifies it against a Deterministic
Finite Automaton which is given through a separate file.

**P2: _Moore Machine_**
- WAP to implement a MOORE MACHINE, where the program
generates an output corresponding to an input string given through the
console.

**P3: _Mealy Machine_**
- WAP to implement a MEALY MACHINE, where the program
generates an output corresponding to an input string given through the
console.

**P4: _NFA to DFA_**
- WAP to implement the conversion of NFA to a corresponding
DFA. The NFA must be given through a separate file.
